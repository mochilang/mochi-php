// Package colour holds the async colouring infrastructure for the
// PHP target. Every function is always Blue (synchronous): Phase 11
// shipped async/await as a synchronous value wrapper (mochi_future_make
// just stores the value, mochi_future_await returns it) rather than
// the originally-planned Amphp/Fiber dispatch, so no PHP function
// ever needs an `Amp\Future<T>` return type and no call site ever
// needs to `await`.
//
// The pass and its result are still wired through build.Build for
// symmetry with the other transpiler3 targets (C, BEAM, JVM, .NET,
// Swift), and to keep a single place to flip the design back to
// real futures if a future MEP wants them.
